            <h2>Identity, Strengths and Values:</h2>
            <p>
              When I was 16 I started powerlifting, I grew up as a bigger kid and wanted to make a change in my lifestyle to try to boost my confidence and I did exactly that. 
              I got pretty strong pretty fast and at 18 I thought I was the man, throwing big weights around with a big ego. 
              The people around me at the time encouraged that behavior so it seemed normal and one day I made the decision to risk serious injury for the sake of looking strong. 
              My friends and I were deadlifting and it felt like I was having a good day so I continued to add more weight in 40 kg increments after each set until I reached 240. 
              The 240 moved fast, and my friends were egging me on to do more so I did, and I severely injured my back as a result. It was stupid and ego driven.
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished highschool and couldn't work out because of my injury, as a result I grew apart from those friends. 
              In the wake of starting tertiary study and running into some old friends from school I met new people, people who are supportive instead of provocative, who to this day have got my back on anything. 
              I went from feeling like I have to prove myself to the people around me, to feeling valued by the people around me having that influence my outlook on others.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have learned a tremendous amount about what I think and what I believe in the last few years and I feel as though I have taken a step back and solidified my strengths and values in that time, 
              whereas prior my strengths and values  were whatever aligned with the people around me for the sake of pleasing the people around me. 
              I am determined to achieve goals that I set my mind to and capable of doing what I need to in order to grow. 
              If I know something needs to be done consistently in order for progress to be made I make it habitual.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I have been limited by perfectionism in the past, and in some ways the need to be perfect in my mind still creeps up on me and bites me. 
              And while I am capable of managing my time when deadlines are in place, 
              I lose track and drag tasks out when there is no deadline because I get caught up in doing as good of a job as I can even when 100% isn't being asked for.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no deadline on my fitness goals so I am more slack on my weekly calorie intake. 
              My strategy to combat this in the last 3 months has been sobriety, which has made an immense difference to the rate at which I am progressing.
              Previously I have tracked my calories, and I still do, however I would throw all my progress away over the weekend while I'm out with my friends which meant while I was progressing, 
              it wasn't as timely as it should have been.
