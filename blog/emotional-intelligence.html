            <h2>Emotional Intelligence:</h2>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence is a person's ability to express, perceive and evaluate emotions, 
              encompassing understanding and being able to relate to others feelings as well as understanding and being able to control one's own feelings. 
              Having emotional intelligence to some degree is incredibly important in working with others with regards to communication and relating to others.
            </p>
            <p>
              EQ (Emotional Quotient) differs from IQ (Intelligence Quotient) in that EQ is a measure of emotional competency, controlling, 
              identifying and using your own emotions as well as being aware of others, while IQ is a measure of knowledge, memory and reasoning. 
              In the workplace EQ is important for having good interpersonal skills whereas performance in your job position is more tied to IQ.
              Another difference is when processing information, EQ contributes to your ability to perceive and understand verbal and visual queues 
              in others whereas IQ contributes to your ability to process information and develop upon your skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being able to understand how you are feeling or what you are experiencing as well as the feelings and experiences of others is important in everyday life.
              EQ encompasses how we pick up on visual and audio queues when we're engaging with others.  It's important to actively focus on improving your EQ,
              which is doable through simply focusing and reflecting on how you feel and being more open minded.
