            <h2>Foundations reflection</h2>
            <p>
              Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego due to the core learning:
              <br /><br />
              1. I've found new ways my ego likes to show in trying to write about myself and at the same time tried to silence it.
              <br /><br />
              2. I've learned that the mindset I've fostered in order to better myself over the last few years is an important skill to have and is a good tool for self improvement.
              <br /><br />
              3. I am capable of learning at a level I was unaware of. I had a lot of trouble in university outside of programming
              and other practical work because we were expected to remember theory without applying it
              which made me feel pretty useless, so far here I have been able to practice and retain everything I have learned.
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming:
              <br /><br />
              Its important to have values, empathy and self-awareness in programming because the majority of the
              time you wont be working on your own and just as in any interaction with others the aforementioned
              qualities are important in fostering a good environment for yourself and others. In learning it is
              important to hold these values to yourself. There is no use in throwing yourself at a problem and
              beating yourself up for not being able to solve it.
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              What surprised me the most about the core learning:
              <br /><br />
              How much I learned about myself in an environment i expected to be mostly programming, i found i
              have learned more about myself and how i can grow than i did new tools for programming
              that i didn't have before, which also gives me a lot of confidence going in to boot camp
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The most challenging aspect of core learning:
              <br /><br />
              Writing about myself is difficult for me, I find myself battling with my ego to not write about myself in too high of a regard
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Why do I think Dev Academy focuses so much on core learning:
              <br /><br />
              As described previously and throughout the course, there are skills to have in learning and life that are
              more impactful than simply knowing how to program. Problem solving is a skill that contributes
              an immense amount to programming to name one. It is important to know how to program in
              a programming course but moreso how to manage yourself and your time.
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Does core feel like a waste of time:
              <br /><br />
              No, if we had just learned how to program we would come out of this course and struggling in the job
              market because we wouldnt know how to work with people or manage ourselves or our time or
              even solve problems to the best of our ability, we would just brute force our way through every programming
              challenge we encounter or piggyback off of the work of others.
