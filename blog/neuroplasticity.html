            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p>
              1. How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?<br />
              Understanding how our brains can develop from successful
              and unsuccessful situations is beneficial for growth. Mistakes reflected on can be
              learned from and so can victories. Shedding the mindset that skill is inherent and cannot be gained
              from repetitions and practice and replacing it with a growth mindset focused on taking 
              from hindsight and applying what you've learned to future events leads to better performance.
              <br /><br />
              2. How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?<br />
              The idea of “not yet” as opposed to failing is
              powerful in that it can change your viewpoint on challenges and make them feel more attainable.
              . Looking back on something in hindsight and wishing you could have done more turns into “next time I will try this”.
              This can have benefits on your performance in challenging situations as you have learned from
              your past experiences as opposed to dwelling on them. As well as this your mindset around failing
              changing to a growth centric mindset is beneficial for mental wellbeing in challenging scenarios
              <br /><br />
              3. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?<br />
              Practice and repetitions, just as physically we can
              become stronger through repetitive resistance training in the gym, our
              brains can get stronger through training via challenging tasks such as puzzles. 
              As well as this, simply understanding that you can do it given time and stepping back from the problem to consider it in a different light or context.

              4. I found this resource interesting to read: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836039/">The Neuroscience of Growth Mindset and Intrinsic Motivation</a>
              <br /><br />
              5. Discuss what it is and why it is relevant<br />
              Growth mindset is the understanding that your talents and abilities can be progressed and developed as opposed to being fixed.
              Talents are widely viewed as a fixed trait that you are born with. Within a growth mindset there is an
              an understanding that skills or talents, such as playing an instrument, are attainable to some degree,
              although you may not be prodigy. A growth mindset is especially relevant to a student because
              believing you can get better at something is paramount to learning about and improving
              upon the skills required to excel in your chosen field. If you believe that you can get better at something, you can.
              <br /><br />
              6. In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?<br />
              This exploration did not surprise me as I've had a similar mindset for the last few years, however different as I tended
              tended to lean into hindsight and dwell on mistakes as failures rather than solely as learning experiences.
              . “I won't do that next time” is not the same as “I will try this next time” where my previous outlook tended towards the former.
              <br /><br />
              7. How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey? <br />
              Learning about growth mindset has taken my outlook from trying to fix mistakes to learning from them and applying what I've learned to future contexts.
