            <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
            <p>
              1. when was I blocked on a simple problem<br />
              Anytime I get stuck on a problem while programming, for any amount of time even if its 5 minutes,
              I take a step back from the problem and try to think about what the steps need to be. A couple 
              years ago I got stuck while trying to apply rules to chess pieces in java. The issue was that I didnt
              really have a gauge at the time on how they behaved other than manually trying to move them
              after running the program so when unexpected outcomes occurred I was confused as to why the
              behavior was seemingly so far off of what I had been trying to create. When trying to figure out the
              knights movement I took a step away from my IDE and wrote down what needed to happen on paper.
              On my chess grid a knight needed to be able to move in all directions 3 cells in one 
              direction and then 1 in the other direction to create the L shape. I drew a grid on paper to represent
              my board and wrote all of the possible movements down, noting that they were +3x +1y, -3x -1y and so on.
              . I felt pretty useless trying to figure it out in my head until I wrote stuff down so I wasnt just trying to
              figure out and remember combinations in my head. I learned that taking breaks and planning
              properly make a huge difference in my workflow and make problems much easier to understand, especially at a point where they feel like a wall.
              <br /><br />
              2. a time when I elegantly solved a problem<br />
              I feel although quite a few of my solutions to Javascript kata were somewhat elegant, at least in my mind they were neatly presented and worked,
              with the exception of my capitalize method where I wanted to test out some methods I had
              been learning about. Pseudocoding helped me get a grasp on the steps I needed to take to solve
              the problems and reading the test results was a huge help in understanding what needed to be done
              to get the result I was looking for, whether that be reading what is currently being outputted
              or seeing the formatting of the string I was returning rather than the expected result. I felt pretty
              good throughout the whole process as I was using similar tools to those I have used in the past,
              quite a few of javascripts methods such as map/forEach/reduce are very similar to streams
              in java which I have a decent amount of experience with. I learned a lot that I CAN do in javascript
              which I was unaware of to some degree prior to testing things out and having a play around with new methods.
              <br /><br />
              3. reflection on how confident I feel using the following problem solving techniques/processes<br />
              Pseudocode - very confident, I generally pseudocode before starting on anything <br /><br />
              Trying something - very confident, most of the time I play around with different ideas to solve a problem before settling on something<br /><br />
              Rubber Ducky Method - quite confident, I do this sometimes but its not generally my first idea to resolve bugs, I will read through my code line by line and ask myself what it should be resulting in.<br /><br />
              Reading error messages - very confident, test results and error messages are bread and butter for me in understanding what is going wrong with a problem<br /><br />
              console.logging  - somewhat confident, I used to do this a lot more when I worked in java and just .println whenever I wanted to see what something was returning at any point in a method, less so now but I still use this technique from time to time<br /><br />
              Googling - very confident, I got very good at googling during my time at uni, specifically trying to find problems in the same wheelhouse as what I was working with or issues while using the same method<br /><br />
              Asking your peers for help - not so confident, I dont generally like asking for help unless I feel like Im absolutely stuck, which is not a good thing and I have been trying to get better at asking for help<br /><br />
              Asking coaches for help - somewhat confident, In the same vein as asking my peers for help although I have been better at asking for help in the public forum of the tech questions channel in discord<br /><br />
              Improving your process with reflection - very confident, Prior to attending Dev Academy I did this passively to a much lower degree with regards to programming but in other walks of life I learn the most from reflection<br /><br />
