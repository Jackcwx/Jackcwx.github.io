            <h2>Javascript DOM:</h2>
            <p>
              When creating a website html and css are used to build the structure of a website and dress it accordingly.
              Whereas javascript is used to make your website interactive, make your buttons do things and make your text update in real time as a few examples.
              An analogy for this could be a car, html is the body, engine and inner workings of the car
              css is the paint and the upholstery and javascript is the wheel and pedals and other controls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Control flow is the order in which code is executed in your program, in layman's terms the computer reads what you've told it to
              do in order from line one to line x. You can think of this as if you're reading a book, 
              you'd never read a book backwards unless it explicitly told you that was the intended order to read it in,
              as the computer will read the instructions you give it in order from top to bottom of the page.
              The computer will always follow this rule unless it comes across some structure that tells it to do otherwise, such as a loop. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Loops iterate through items that you tell them to, such as a list of people, and execute commands on those items that you specify. 
              For instance if I wanted to find all the members of a class with a grade of below an A,
              I could tell the computer to loop through the list of class members, find the grade of the class member
              , and if the grade is not an A add them to a list of class members that will be returned to me when the loop finishes.
              If the military was to draft people for war for instance, they would want to find able bodied individuals.
              Similarly to how a loop functions applicants would be checked and either added to an acceptance list or denied
            </p>
            <p>
              The DOM is an interface that treats an html document as a tree structure with node objects representing each part of that document.
              It can be helpful in visualizing the components of your website as well as locating them by their ID,
              class, tag mane, etc. the DOM can also be used to make changes to the code in your web browser
              without affecting your actual document, therefore letting you test stuff before implementing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Objects and arrays are both used to hold information, objects can hold many named variables whereas arrays are a collection of items,
              which themselves can be objects. When retrieving information from an array the item in the
              collection is specified, item one for example, and the method is called to retrieve that variable.
              With objects the named variable is specified when being called for and is retrieved via a few methods,
              objectName.propertyName being one example.
            </p>
            <p>
              In javascript a function is a block of code written to perform a particular task, the aforementioned list example would be written in a function that creates a new list,
              iterates through the list of class members, then returns a newly filled list containing all the students
              who got a specified grade. Functions are useful in accomplishing tasks in a neat blocked out way as well as breaking problems down.
