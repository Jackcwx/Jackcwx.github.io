              <h2>Classes vs ids</h2>
              <p>
                classes and ids in html are used to organize styling in css,
                classes allow styling to apply to any piece of code you tack the
                class on to, whereas ids are used to style an individual item.
                in the event I wanted all my paragraphs to look the same way,
                but maybe I wanted the text of one to be green I would use a
                paragraph class to standardize my webpage, and with the one
                paragraph an id would be used to give it special rules<br />
                classes and ids do very similar things but with different
                applications a good rule of thumb is to think about how often
                you will stylize something in that particular way, if you're
                only going to do it to a single element on a page, use an id,
                otherwise if the scale is large And you'll frequently be
                referring to that format, use a class. <br />
                on my webpage I've used a single id for the checkbox that allows
                the menu to function when using a mobile device:
              </p>
              <img src="/blog/check.PNG" class="center" />
              <p>
                this is because there are conditions that only apply to that one
                element of my navigation bar and won't be reused anywhere else.
                whereas for example flexbox is used with standardized formatting
                for all my blog posts.
