            <h2>Learning Plan:</h2>
            <p>
              1. My long term goal for my career pathway is simply to take the dive in to this 
              profession that I am passionate about and try to make something of myself. <br /><br />
              2. Strength wise I am determined and capable of accomplishing things I set my mind to, however weakness
              wise I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist. <br /><br />
              3. I would like to see my teamwork capabilities in situations I am unfarmilliar with improve. I believe I am capable
              when dealing with issues I've seen before but I'm less confident when the problem is new to me.<br /><br />
              4. I have been and will continue to work in sensible hours, sleep enough and stay ahead of my work.
              As well as this I will try to stop myself from going down the rabbit hole to make something perfect when
              what is asked of me is "function". <br/>
              When things start getting to me I will step away and take a look at the problem from a distance.<br /><br />
              5. I will seek help in the allocated discord channel when I feel like I might need help not after I've known I need help
              but I dont want help.<br /><br />
              6. From the facilitation team I expect clarity transparency, both of which are already apparent.<br /><br />
              7. my routine forms around Dev Academy, my other commitments have been fit either before or after my working day
              these include gym, time with family, walking dog, etc.<br /><br />

              Sprint 5 update: Bootcamp Learning Plan
              <br /><br />
              What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
              <br /><br />
              simply to make a living in an industry im interested in, previously i had a big interest in
              cyber security but ive found i prefer programming to theory
              <br /><br />
              What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
              <br /><br />
              I think my biggest strengths will be working with people and solving the actual problems at hand,
              however i think my weakness will be managing myself and keeping a healthy schedule outside of bootcamp
              for the first couple of weeks.
              <br /><br />
              What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
              <br /><br />
              as mentioned previously, managing my time outside of the work at hand. for my own sake I need to be able to
              get to the gym 6 days a week and spend time with my partner so I will need some small adjustment to manage to fit
              stuff in and keep a healthy amount of sleep
              <br /><br />
              What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
              <br /><br />
              I would like to see my reflection skills improve further, previously I have a tendency to see things as a butterfly
              effect where I make a mistake and it leads to more however I have been shaking that mentality in recent times.
              <br /><br />
              What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
              <br /><br />
              clairty more than anything. I dont want my hand held or anything I just want to know whats going on
              as I have through foundations. 
              <br /><br />
              What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
              <br /><br />
              I expect myself to do good work in a timely manner and gel well with the people in my team, I know i have resources
              to reach out to in the people around me as well as the facilitators. In my interactions with others attending
              this course and running it I am confident that I will be able to work safely and productively with other learners.
              I am also confident in my ability to manage the workload however I need to keep my workload from bleeding in to the 
              time I need to spend on myself and that will be my biggest challenge, which I will overcome.
