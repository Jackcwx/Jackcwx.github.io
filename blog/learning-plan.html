            <h2>Learning Plan:</h2>
            <p>
              1. My long term goal for my career pathway is simply to take the dive in to this 
              profession that I am passionate about and try to make something of myself. <br /><br />
              2. Strength wise I am determined and capable of accomplishing things I set my mind to, however weakness
              wise I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist. <br /><br />
              3. I would like to see my teamwork capabilities in situations I am unfarmilliar with improve. I believe I am capable
              when dealing with issues I've seen before but I'm less confident when the problem is new to me.<br /><br />
              4. I have been and will continue to work in sensible hours, sleep enough and stay ahead of my work.
              As well as this I will try to stop myself from going down the rabbit hole to make something perfect when
              what is asked of me is "function". <br/>
              When things start getting to me I will step away and take a look at the problem from a distance.<br /><br />
              5. I will seek help in the allocated discord channel when I feel like I might need help not after I've known I need help
              but I dont want help.<br /><br />
              6. From the facilitation team I expect clarity transparency, both of which are already apparent.<br /><br />
              7. my routine forms around Dev Academy, my other commitments have been fit either before or after my working day
              these include gym, time with family, walking dog, etc.
